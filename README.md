# [🚀 CV website 🌍](http://vicenteortiz.me)

This is the code for my CV.

Keep it *simple*:
- 💻 HTML/SCSS + custom template ([build.js](https://github.com/pouyio/cv/blob/master/build.js)) to support several languages.
- 📦 Vite.
- 📄 PDF version built with puppeteer and custom css ([pdf.js](https://github.com/pouyio/cv/blob/master/pdf.js), no more Office 🤯).
- 🚀 CD is just a [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) hook.,
