# CV website
Website code beneath my online [curriculum vitae](http://vicenteortiz.me). Pretty plain and sober site.

This site is hosted in github pages but redirectioned from my own domain using a CNAME file.

Tools I have used:
+ Plain HTML/CSS/Javascript.
+ [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to automate repetitive tasks such as [auto-prefixing style sheets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer) or [reloading the browser](https://www.browsersync.io) on any local changes.
